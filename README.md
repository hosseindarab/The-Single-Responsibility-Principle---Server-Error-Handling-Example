# ðŸš€ Single-responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

In this example we use different classes in order to serve http client requests and handling any possible error globally in the application. 

These steps have been done by using SRP that allows us to write clean and better code in an application.

This project has been created using **webpack-cli**, you can now run

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

to bundle your application.

If you are in development phase, then use the following command in order to run the application

```
webpack --watch
```
